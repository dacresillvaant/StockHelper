A simple Spring Boot application designed to assist with stock market data analysis and monitoring. The application uses automated web scraping, and scheduled  alerts to help me track my stocks and look for right timing to buy and sell various stock instruments.

Application has only back-end layer and I do not plan to add any front-end functionalities. Everything is based on API, mail notifications and access to database.

I do not have rigidly set goals for this application, as the functionality changes within my needs. In the beginning I planned to write it to remind myself how Spring works, although now it is 24/7 running application which is useful for me.


## Features

- 📊 **Automated Heatmap Scraping**: Scheduled web scraping using Playwright to capture and analyze market heatmaps - right now app only saves the data, I migh use it later for trend analysis
- 📧 **Email Notifications**: Automated alerts for low prices, owned stock updates, and currency rate changes via Mailgun which is configured for my own domain
- 🔒 **Secure API**: Protected endpoints with Spring Security Basic Authentication
- 📈 **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Real-time data from Alpha Vantage and Twelve Data APIs
- ⏰ **Scheduling**: Parallel execution of scheduled tasks for heatmap scraping, price alerts, and currency monitoring
- 🗄️ **Persistent Storage**: PostgreSQL database for reliable data management
- 🌐 **RESTful API**: Clean, well-structured endpoints for stock data retrieval and analysis

## Technologies Used

**Backend Framework:**
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.3
- Spring Web (RESTful APIs)
- Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
- Spring Data JPA (Database persistence)

**AI & Intelligence:**
- Spring AI with OpenAI integration - I was going to use it with agents in order to analyze data and get suggestions, although I will probably dump this approach

**Security:**
- Spring Security (Basic Authentication)

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL 42.7.5
- Hibernate ORM

**External APIs:**
- OpenAI API - AI-powered analysis - will be probabvly removed
- Alpha Vantage API - Stock market data
- Twelve Data API - Stock market data
- Mailgun API - Email notifications

**Web Scraping:**
- Microsoft Playwright 1.50.0 - Automated browser control for dynamic content

**Testing:**
- TestNG 7.11.0
- Mockito 5.17.0

**Other Tools:**
- Lombok - Boilerplate code reduction
- JavaCV 1.5.11 - Image/video processing
- Maven - Build automation

## Deployment & Infrastructure

**Production Environment:**
- ☁️ **Cloud Hosting**: Deployed on Hetzner VPS (Virtual Private Server)
- 🐧 **Operating System**: Debian Linux configured from scratch
- 🚀 **Deployment Strategy**: Manual deployment via simple custom shell script
- ⚙️ **Process Management**: Running as systemd service for 24/7 uptime
- 🔐 **Security**: Environment-based secrets management, SSH key authentication
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Application logs and scheduled task execution tracking, mail notification whenever unhalded exception happens

### Scheduled Tasks / Usage

The application runs several automated tasks:

- **Heatmap Scraping**: Every 5 minutes (`0 */5 * * * *`)
  - Captures market heatmap data for trend analysis - each screenshot is analyzed based od red/green pixel count in order to give it a ratio (0.01 - 1.00), which tells if heatmap data is bullish or bearish
  
- **Currency Rate Processing**: Daily at 8 AM and 4 PM (`0 0 8,16 * * *`)
  - Monitors USD/PLN currency rate - can be easily modified to track more currency pairs
  - Sends daily mail notifications

- **Low Price Alerts**: 9:15 PM, Monday-Saturday (`0 15 21 ? * MON-SAT`)
  - Monitors configured stocks - at the moment - V, MA
  - Mail notification alerts when prices drop below threshold percentages

- **Owned Stock Alerts**: Saturdays at 8:15 AM (`0 15 8 ? * SAT`)
  - Weekly check of owned stock performance
  - Mail notification only when price changes more than 30% from purchase value

All scheduled tasks can be run in parallel for optimal performance.


## Highlights

This project demonstrates practical implementation of modern Spring Boot development practices:

✅ **Microservices-Ready Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with service layers, DTOs, and configuration management

✅ **Advanced Scheduling**: Parallel task execution with ThreadPoolTaskScheduler for efficient resource utilization

✅ **Security Best Practices**: Protected API endpoints with environment-based credential management

✅ **Web Scraping**: Automated data collection from dynamic websites using Playwright

✅ **Multi-Source Integration**: Aggregation of data from multiple financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data)
